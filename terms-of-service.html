  <main class="container my-5 bg-white p-5 rounded shadow-sm">
    <h2 class="mb-4 head-text">Terms of Service</h2>
    <p>Welcome to PetBnB! By using our platform, you agree to the following terms and conditions:</p>

    <p class="fw-bold">PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. SECTION 17 INCLUDES A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND SECTION 19 INCLUDES A CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH AFFECT HOW DISPUTES ARE RESOLVED.</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li class="fw-bold">Acceptance of Terms; Modifications.</li>
        <p>These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) are a binding legal agreement between you and A Place for Rover, Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of Delaware with a registered office at 711 Capitol Way S., Suite 204, Olympia, WA 98501 (“Rover,” “we,” “us” and “our”). The Terms govern your use of our software applications, resources and services for pet owners and pet service providers to find each other, communicate with each other, and arrange for the provision of pet care services, and any other services or products we may offer from time to time (collectively, our “Rover Service”). The Terms govern all use of the Rover Service, whether you access it from our website at https://www.rover.com (including any subdomain or localized version) (the “Site”), our mobile applications and mobile websites, our Facebook application, our online or phone support offerings, or any other access point we make available to you. Our Rover Guarantee Terms, Reservation Protection Policy, and other Policies applicable to your use of the Rover Service are incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS DURING THE ACCOUNT SIGN-UP PROCESS OR ACCESSING OR USING THE ROVER SERVICE WITHOUT AN ACCOUNT, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, YOU SHOULD NOT ACCEPT THEM, IN WHICH CASE YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE THE ROVER SERVICE.</p>
        <p>You understand and agree that we may change the Terms from time to time, and that any such changes will be effective (except as otherwise described in Section 17.10 below) when we post the modified Terms on the Rover Service, unless otherwise required by applicable law. Your continued access and use of the Rover Service after we post the modified Terms will constitute your consent to be bound by the modified Terms.</p>
        <li class="fw-bold">Rover Service.</li>
        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.1 Nature of the Rover Service.</span> The Rover Service consists of a desktop Web application, mobile applications, and other related tools, support and services that pet owners (“Pet Owners”) and providers of pet-related services (“Service Providers”) can use to find, communicate with and interact with each other. The Rover Service includes our emergency support services, educational materials for Service Providers, and other services. </p>
       

        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.2 Rover does not provide Pet Care Services.</span> Rover is a neutral venue for Service Providers and Pet Owners. Rover is not a Service Provider and, except for emergency phone support and other resources and support specifically described in the Rover Service, does not provide pet care services. We make no representations or warranties about the quality of boarding, pet sitting, dog walking, house sitting, or other services provided by Service Providers (“Pet Care Services”), or about your interactions and dealings with users. Service Providers listed on Rover are not under the direction or control of Rover, and Service Providers determine in their own discretion how to provide Pet Care Services. Though we provide general guidance on our Site to Service Providers about safety and pet care and to Pet Owners about selecting and engaging Service Providers, Rover does not employ, recommend or endorse Service Providers or Pet Owners, and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we will not be responsible or liable for the performance or conduct of Service Providers or Pet Owners, whether online or offline. We conduct an initial review of Service Provider profiles and, as permitted by law, we facilitate Background Checks or Identity Verifications (each as described in Section 10, below) on Service Providers conducted by a third party, but, except where explicitly specified in the Rover Service (and then only to the extent specified), do not perform additional screening of Service Providers or Pet Owners. You should exercise caution and use your independent judgment before engaging a Service Provider, providing Pet Care Services, or otherwise interacting with users via the Rover Service. Pet Owners and Service Providers are solely responsible for making decisions that are in the best interests of themselves and their pets. For example, each user of the Rover Service is responsible for keeping current his or her own pet’s vaccinations, and we will have no liability for anyone’s failure to vaccinate his or her pet.
        </p>
        
         <p class=""><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.3 Release.</span> Subject to Section 16 below, Rover has no liability for any claims, injuries, loss, harm and/or damages arising from and/or in any way related to your interactions or dealings with other users and the acts and/or omissions of Service Providers and Pet Owners, whether online or offline. You acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by the applicable law, YOUR USE AND/OR PROVISION OF PET CARE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RISK. (Any financial obligations Rover may have to its users in connection with user conduct are limited to the reimbursement obligations set forth in the Rover Guarantee.)
         </p>

         <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.4 Transactions are between Pet Owners and Service Providers.</span> The Rover Service may be used to find and offer Pet Care Services and to facilitate payment, but all transactions conducted via the Rover Service are between Pet Owners and Service Providers. Except for the limited refunds and “Reservation Protection” specified in Section 9.6 and the Rover Guarantee, you agree that Rover has no liability for damages associated with Pet Care Services (which may include bodily injury to, or death of, a pet) or resulting from any other transactions between users of the Rover Service.
         </p>

         <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.5 Bookings</span> Pet Owners and Service Providers transact with each other on the Rover Service when they both agree to a “booking” that specifies the fees, time period, cancellation policy, and other terms for provision of Pet Care Services via the booking mechanism provided on the Rover Service (a “Booking”). A Booking may be initiated by either a Service Provider or a Pet Owner by selecting the type(s) of Pet Care Services to be provided and then following the prompts that appear on-screen. If you are a Pet Owner and you initiate a Booking, you agree to pay for the Pet Care Services described in the Booking when you click “Request to book.” If you are a Pet Owner and a Service Provider initiates a Booking, you agree to pay for the Pet Care Services described in the Booking when you click “Pay Now.” All requests are subject to acceptance by the receiving party. The receiving party is not obligated to accept your (or any) request and may, at their discretion, decline for any reason. Once you complete a Booking, you agree to honor the price and other terms of that Booking, as acknowledged in the Booking confirmation.
         </p>

          <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.6 Pet Owners are Solely Responsible for Evaluating Service Providers.</span> Pet Owners are solely responsible for evaluating the suitability of Service Providers for the services they offer to provide. Please visit the Help Center for guidance about making informed decisions about engaging Service Providers. Though Rover performs a limited review of Service Provider profiles and facilitates Service Provider Background Checks or Identity Verifications conducted by a third party, any such screening is limited, and Rover does not warrant that any such screen is accurate, complete, conclusive or up-to-date. Similarly, Rover does not endorse reviews of Service Providers by other Pet Owners that may be available via the Rover Service, and Rover makes no commitments that such reviews are accurate or legitimate.
         </p>
          

          <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.7 Abandoned Pets; Re-homing.</span> Pet Owners who arrange for Pet Care Services and fail to retrieve their pet after the service period identified in a Booking agree that Rover (or the Service Provider) may, in its (or his or her) sole discretion, place the pet in foster care, transfer care to animal control or other law enforcement authorities, or find other alternate care. Pet Owner agrees to reimburse Rover and/or the Service Provider for all costs and expenses associated with such actions. Further, Rover expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to remove a Pet Owner’s pet from a Service Provider’s care should Rover deem it necessary for the safety of a pet, the Service Provider, or any persons living with the Service Provider. Prior to removing a pet from the care of a Service Provider, Rover will use reasonable efforts during its normal business hours to contact the Pet Owner and/or the Pet Owner’s emergency contact (if provided) to arrange alternative care. Should Rover not be able to contact the Pet Owner or the emergency contact, Rover will use its best judgment to find alternative care for the pet until the Pet Owner is able to retrieve his/her pet. If you are a Pet Owner, you authorize your pet’s veterinarian(s) to release your pet’s veterinary records to Rover in connection with any such relocation or re-homing of your pet. In addition, you are responsible for and agree to pay all costs and expenses incurred by Rover in connection with such transfer.
         </p>

         <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.8 Emergencies.</span> We recommend that Pet Owners give their Service Providers contact information where they can be reached in the event medical care for a pet becomes necessary, and to provide an emergency contact in the Pet Owner profile, who has consented to the disclosure of their information. Service Providers agree to immediately contact Pet Owners in the event such care becomes necessary or, if the Pet Owner is not available, to contact Rover at the applicable telephone number or email address listed in the table at the end of these Terms. If you are a Pet Owner, you hereby authorize your Service Provider, your emergency contact, and/or Rover to obtain and authorize the provision of veterinary care for your pet if you cannot be reached to authorize care yourself in an emergency situation. In such case, you also authorize your pet’s veterinarian(s) to release your pet’s veterinary records to Rover and your Service Provider. You release the Service Provider and Rover for any injury, damage or liability arising from the provision of emergency care or the failure to seek such care pursuant to this section, including from reimbursement that may otherwise have been available under the Rover Guarantee. Pet Owners are responsible for the costs of any such medical treatment for pets and, if you are a Pet Owner, you hereby authorize Rover to charge your credit card or other payment method for such costs. In certain circumstances, a Pet Owner may be eligible for reimbursement under the Rover Guarantee. Rover recommends that all users have adequate pet insurance to cover the costs of veterinary care.
         </p>

         <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.9 Consultation Services.</span> Rover may offer Pet Owners and Service Providers phone, chat, or email veterinary consultation services from a third party to provide an educational resource for decisions you make about your own pets or pets in your care. These consultation services are provided by a third party, and are not a part of the Rover Service. If you use these third party consultation services, you should use them only in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for, professional veterinary care. You agree to resort solely to the applicable third party consultation service in the event of any claims arising from their services.
         </p>

         <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2.10 Google Maps. </span>  Use of the Rover Service requires use of Google Maps features and content, which are subject to the current (1) Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service at https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html (including the Acceptable Use Policy at https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms/aup/); and (2) Google Privacy Policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ (collectively, the "Google Terms"). By using the Rover Service, you acknowledge and agree to the Google Terms as they apply to you (e.g., as an "End User"). Any unauthorized use of the Google Maps features and content may result in your suspension or termination from the Rover Service.
         </p>

         <li class="fw-bold">Certification of Compliance with Applicable Law.</li>
         <p>By accessing and using the Rover Service, you certify that you: (1) are at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher, and (2) will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to your activities conducted through, or related to, the Rover Service.</p>
         <ul>
            <li>For Pet Owners, this means, among other things, that you will ensure that your pets are vaccinated, licensed, identification-tagged and/or microchipped as required by local laws or regulations; that you have obtained and will maintain any mandatory insurance policies concerning the pets whose care you entrust to Service Providers (and that such policies will benefit third parties, including Service Providers, to the same extent they benefit you).</li>
            <li>For Service Providers, this means, among other things, that you certify that you are legally eligible to provide Pet Care Services in the jurisdiction where you provide Pet Care Services; that you have complied and will comply with all laws and regulations that are applicable to you; that you have obtained all business licenses, business tax registrations, trade licenses, and permits necessary to provide Pet Care Services legally; and that, when providing Pet Care Services, you will comply with applicable leash, pet waste disposal, and similar laws.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>You acknowledge that Rover is entitled to rely on these certifications from you, is not responsible to ensure that all users have complied with applicable laws and regulations, and will not be liable for a user’s failure to do so.</p>
         <li>Use of the Rover Service; Suspension.</li>

         <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4.1 Your Conduct on the Rover Service.
